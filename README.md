# Hodgekin-Huxley-Model
An implementation of the Hodgekin Huxley model of a neuron in native Swift.

The Hodgkin-Huxley model is an influential model in neuroscience, developed by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in 1952. It provides insights into the behavior of neurons and explains how they generate and propagate electrical signals, known as action potentials. This implementation is a practice I chose because of my interest in neuroscience and computational biology.
